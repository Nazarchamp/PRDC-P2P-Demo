# PRDC-P2P-Demo
To run the demo first you need to create a ScaleDrone channel. This process is free and takes very little time, simply go to: https://www.scaledrone.com/, create an account, then press the green create a channel button in the top right.

After you have a channel, copy the channel ID and insert it into this demo in the js script.

To run the demo simply open the index.html, then copy the URL to another tab and you have your peer to peer connection. The demo generates a random query parameter which represents the ScaleDrone room it is connecting to, if no parameter already exists. When you copy the URL to another tab this query parameter is then recognized in that tab and it connects to that room.
